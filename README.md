GIVEN I am a baseball fan, I WANT to see the weather forecast for upcoming games in my home team's city to help me decide if I should buy a ticket.

- WHEN I search for a city or team<br>
THEN I am presented with the upcoming schedule of home games and the a weather overview for those days
- WHEN I click on a particular game<br>
THEN I am presented with detailed information about the weather forecast for that day

THEN I see visual cues (color, icons, text) indicating whether it's a good or bad day to go to a game
- WHEN I chose a team with no home games in the next 10 days<br>
THEN I see a message that there are no upcoming games
- WHEN I return to the site<br>
THEN I see results for my favorite team, with an option to search for another team
